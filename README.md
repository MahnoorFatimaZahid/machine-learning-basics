## 1. What is Machine Learning and When is it Useful?  

Machine Learning (ML) is a field of AI that allows systems to **learn patterns from data** and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.  

üëâ Useful when rules are too complex to program manually, like:  
- Speech recognition  
- Fraud detection  
- Recommendation systems

## 2. AI vs ML vs DL  

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Broad concept of machines mimicking human intelligence.  
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Subset of AI that learns patterns from data.  
- **Deep Learning (DL):** Subset of ML using neural networks with many layers.

## 3. Types of ML  

- **Supervised Learning** ‚Üí Data has both input and output (answers are known).  
  *Example: Predicting house prices from size and location.*  

- **Unsupervised Learning** ‚Üí Data has only input (no answers). The goal is to find patterns.  
  *Example: Grouping customers by buying habits.*  

- **Reinforcement Learning** ‚Üí An agent learns by trial and error.  
  *Example: Training a robot to walk.*  

### Semi-Supervised Learning  
A mix of labeled and unlabeled data.  
*Example: Few labeled medical images + many unlabeled ones.*  

### More Types of Unsupervised Learning  
- **Clustering** ‚Üí Grouping similar data points.  
- **Dimensionality Reduction** ‚Üí Reduce features while keeping information.  
- **Anomaly Detection** ‚Üí Detecting unusual events (e.g., fraud).  
- **Association Rule Learning** ‚Üí Finding relationships (e.g., bread ‚Üí butter).

---

## 5. Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning  

- **Instance-Based:** Memorizes examples, compares new ones (e.g., KNN).  
- **Model-Based:** Builds a general model (e.g., Linear Regression).  

---

## 6. Challenges in ML  

- Poor quality or insufficient data

## 9. ML Engineer vs Data Analyst vs Data Scientist  

- **Data Analyst:** Analyzes and visualizes data.  
- **Data Scientist:** Builds models and applies ML.  
- **ML Engineer:** Deploys and scales ML in production.

## 10. Tensors  

Tensors = multi-dimensional arrays used in deep learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch).  

- 0D: Scalar ‚Üí `2`  
- 1D: Vector ‚Üí `[1, 2, 3]`  
- 2D: Matrix ‚Üí `[[1, 8], [2, 4]]`  
- 3D: RGB image ‚Üí `(H, W, C)`  
- 4D: Batch of images ‚Üí `(N, H, W, C)`  
- 5D: Video ‚Üí `(N, T, H, W, C)`

## 11. End-to-End Example (Overview)  

1. Frame the problem (predict house prices).  
2. Collect data (CSV, SQL, APIs).  
3. Clean & preprocess data.  
4. Perform EDA.  
5. Train model.  
6. Evaluate accuracy.  
7. Deploy model.  

---

## 12. Framing a Problem

- Input data  
- Output predictions  
- Evaluation metrics  

---

## 13. Data Gathering  

- **CSV Files** ‚Üí load with pandas  
- **JSON Files** ‚Üí structured data  
- **SQL Databases** ‚Üí query with SQL  
- **APIs** ‚Üí fetch live data  
- **Web Scraping** ‚Üí extract from websites

- Missing values  
- Duplicates  
- Data types  
- Distributions  

---

## 15. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 16. Feature Engineering  

Feature Engineering = **transforming raw data into meaningful features** that improve ML performance.  

### Why Important?  
- Boosts model accuracy  
- Handles missing/noisy data  
- Improves generalization  
- Highlights useful patterns  

### Techniques  
- Handling missing data  
- Feature creation (e.g., BMI)  
- Feature transformation (log, binning, polynomials)  
- **Feature scaling (see next section)**  

---

## 17. Feature Scaling  

Different features can have very different ranges (e.g., income = 1000‚Äì100000 vs age = 18‚Äì70).  

### Why Scaling Matters  
- Prevents dominance of large-value features  
- Improves convergence (gradient descent)  
- Helps distance-based algorithms (KNN, clustering)  

### Types of Scaling  

1. **Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)**  
   - Scales values between 0‚Äì1.  
   - Formula:  
     ```
     X' = (X - Xmin) / (Xmax - Xmin)
     ```  
   - Best for bounded data (e.g., Neural Nets).  

2. **Standardization (Z-score Scaling)**  
   - Mean = 0, Std Dev = 1.  
   - Formula:  
     ```
     X' = (X - Œº) / œÉ
     ```  
   - Best when data is Gaussian.  

3. **Robust Scaling**  
   - Uses median + IQR (less sensitive to outliers).  

4. **MaxAbs Scaling**  
   - Scales between -1 and 1 (good for sparse data).

## 18. Encoding Categorical Data  

ML models require **numeric input**, not text.  

### Types of Categorical Data  
- **Nominal:** No order (e.g., colors, countries).  
- **Ordinal:** Ordered categories (e.g., education level).  

### Encoding Techniques  

1. **One-Hot Encoding (Nominal)**  
   - Red, Green, Blue ‚Üí `[1,0,0]`, `[0,1,0]`, `[0,0,1]`  
   - Works well but increases dimensions.  

2. **Ordinal Encoding (Ordinal)**  
   - Education ‚Üí School = 0, UG = 1, PG = 2  
   - Preserves order but assumes equal spacing.  

3. **Label Encoding**  
   - Red = 0, Green = 1, Blue = 2  
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Misleading for nominal data (model may assume order).  

4. **Target / Mean Encoding**  
   - Replaces category with mean of target variable.  
   - Example: "Location = CityA" ‚Üí average house price in CityA.
